Get discord notifications when user-selected Kick and Twitch streams are live

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rock Bot webscrapes Kick's public API and utilizes Twitch API to determine live streamers.

Within minutes of your favorite streamer going live, your discord server will be notified.

# Overview

Kick websites are webscraped every 5 minutes and stored inside a postgreSQL table.
